Default node names (FileSet_0, etc).

Align SetParam boxes; allow longer parameter names ('baseline1_mean_half_width' is truncated!)

Room for parameter explanation (or use tool tip)?

nested tags (cell, condition)

if save with new name, replace that as default? link to tree name?

save menu option

problem with mdp importing configuration module that doesn't exist

be nicer if fileSet contains nothing (currently cryptic assertion error)
be nicer if tags contain nothing
be nicer if tag not set in average

deal with missing sweeps

understand detection
detect able to set meaningless param 'absolute' for the baseline - check param universe?
win0 can be too small
baseline window is in time not points (indicate)
more generally, parameters need help strings

be able to save a node-full of parameters

wishlist - save groups of nodes (with and without parameters)

add check in tags for fewer input sweeps
allow parallel input for tags (like I use detect)

if tag is set in average before it has been created in tags -> disaster

make tags parallel to avoid transferring data?

default basename, data, analysis paths; config in home directory to enable switching between home and work with different users.

return on setparam dialog doesn't update/apply

add connect button and indicator of connection to connect dialog; don't need to dismiss it each connection

wishlist - abort long calculations

checkout types for displaysweep input - shouldn't display garbage

setparam shouldn't be in view menu?

is this kind of escaping necessary?
print '''list_files has probably changed since tagType creation, 
            some tags might be corrupted if you don\'t update them (dirty 
            fileSet should work)'''
(FileSet.py)            

figure Dialoge Figure_0

youhou is hello not goodbye

save() needs to be clever about parsing name with path (and maybe to print message with tree.home if it fails)

should sweep._getdata be concatenating lists instead of indexing in the numpy array?

search for leaf CONFIG between pwd and home?

prefer V/unit in ChannelType?

how to delete nodes?

enable .dat as well as .abf for pclamp files

actualiseDisplay -> updateDisplay (in DisplaySweepWidget)

move graphviz colour params to some central default - hardly worth having individual colours (or organise random colours)

Is FileSet too complicated? (possibly beginning of model/view controller?)

deal automatically with dirty FileSet?

    def samplingInterval(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return 'dunno'
        
PClampFile inputSweep method around line 330. Couple of TODOs: caching and possible need to adjust file information earlier to account for acquisitions truncated before the planned end of the protocol.

For Figure_0 etc, the embedded figure can be resized programatically, but the dialog doesn't adjust itself. maybe it could - very minor.

On gerd (French locale), decimal comma poses problem in displaysweep limits (only some of them) and many of the parameter selection boxes.
